	<h1>Examples On Big data</h1>
	<h3>Practical Examples</h3>
	<div>The Great Hydron Collider has 150 million sensors that provide data 40 million times per second.  There are approximately 600 million collisions per second.  But we're dealing with sensor current data, the data flow from all four crash experiments is 25 petabytes.  Less than 0.001% Amazon.com handles millions of background transactions every day, as well as inquiries from more than half a million third-party vendors.  Amazon relies mainly on the Linux system to be able to deal with this huge amount of data, and Amazon owns the 3 largest Linux databases in the world, which have a capacity of 7.8, 18.5 and 24.7 TB.  Walmart's 9 store chain handles more than a million transactions per hour, which are imported into databases estimated to contain more than 2.5 petabytes (2560 terabytes) of data - equal to 167 times the data in all books in the Library of Congress in the states  United.</div>
