	<h1>Properties of BigData</h1>
	<p>Big data properties In order for the data to be huge, three main factors must be present:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Size: It is the number of terabytes of data that we release daily.</li>
		<li>Diversity: It is the diversity of this data between structured, non-structured and semi-structured</li>
		<li>Speed: How quickly the occurrence of data occurs, for example the speed of posting tweets differs from the speed of scanning remote sensors of climate changes.</li>
	</ol>
	<div>But what are the characteristics of big data?  Big data is distinguished by size, variety, and speed.  By studying the large volume of data companies can better understand their customers, imagine, for example, researching the purchasing data of a million people dealing with Wal-Mart store, this research and analysis of the vast amount of purchase invoices and the frequency and diversity of purchases, will give very useful information to management and decision makers.</div>
